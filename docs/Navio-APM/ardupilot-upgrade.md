#### Overview

We're now in process of transitioning our deploy scheme. That's why we strongly encourage you to look into this article.
For a year our users had been asked to install a *deb* package with a ```dpkg -i``` command. This is a rather cumbersome way to get things done.
From now on we deploy the packages to our repository making it possible to use ```apt-get``` out of the box.

#### General warnings

Please, backup your parameters before proceeding!

#### Upgrade

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo apt-get update
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade 
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo apt-get install apm-navio-beta
```
